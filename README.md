# Finger-Game-Map

Brute force algorithm to map out all possible game states for a two player version of the finger game

Currently just generates a rooted graph where GameState objects are the vertices
and the list of connected states in each GameState represents edges

Crashed my laptop so will need to run on a uni computer overnight

##TODO:

    * Write a DFS algorithm to find the shortest path to a halting state
    * Design a better system for displaying each vertex and moves from it

##USAGE:

    `chmod +x GameState.py`
    `./GameState.py`
